TITLE OF PROJECT: MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

GROUP MEMBERS: KEVIN THAKKAR, VINAYAK SOMVANSHI, YOGESH KUMBHAR

DESCRIPTION: In this hustling world, entertainment is a necessity for each one of us to refresh our mood and energy.
Entertainment regains our confidence for work and we can work more enthusiastically. For revitalizing ourselves,
we can listen to our preferred music or can watch movies of our choice. For searching favorable movies online,
we can utilize movie recommendation systems, which are more reliable, since searching for preferred movies will
require more and more time which one cannot afford to waste. In this project, movies are recommended to user
based on the content theyâ€™ve typed into the search bar and desired list of movies are shown as output. This system
relies on API, through which it will be able to recommend a large variety of movies. Since this system uses API,
it also helps to keep track of the most recently released movies. The systemuses the filter search feature to improve
the user experience. Providing different filter options to the users can help them in finding a specific movie to
watch. This system has a login/registration feature, which allows registered users to add films to their watchlist
so they can keep track of the films they want to watch. The movies will also provide users with additional
information like date of release, synopsis, cast, rating, and a frame to play trailer of the same.
